// Config originally created May 11, 2019 - Updated August 24, 2019
// EXEC THIS MANUALLY, DO NOT EXEC THE BASE.CFG
// This is commented as extensively as I could manage!

exec "rgl_mm_base"

servercfgfile 	"rgl_mm_5cp" // sets server cfg to this config so that it gets autoexeced on level change

mp_timelimit "0" // sets server timelimit to 30 minutes
mp_winlimit "3" // sets # of wins to win the scrim to 5
mp_windifference "0" // unsets windifference
mp_maxrounds "0" // unsets maxrounds

mp_tournament_restart // restarts the tournament to apply above settings


say "RGL No Restriction 6s 5cp Config Executed."
say "First to 3 wins! There is no timelimit."
say "To be safe, please ***CHANGELEVEL*** to reload all settings properly and prevent any crashes."
say "To end the game early for whatever reason, simply reexec this config."
say "Exec rgl_off or restart your server 90 seconds after you have fully finished playing."
