tv_maxclients "5" // source tv max clients. you can set it to something reasonable in case you have a popular match happening and you don't want to have your server crash if you don't have a relay set up.

//tv_autorecord 0 // remove the two slashes at the very beginning of this line if you use a sourcemod plugin to autorecord stvs.

//hostname "RGL Highlander Match" // server name in server browser. change this if you want
//tv_name "RGL Highlander Match (STV)" // stv name in scoreboard and stv name in stv server browser
//tv_port "27020" // STV port, uncomment and change it if you need to

//sv_password "changeme" // server password. uncomment and set to whatever you want to have a custom password only for competitive matches >>>passwords are required for matches<<<
//tv_password "changeme" // STV password, uncomment and set to whatever you want so randoms can't join your STV without a password
