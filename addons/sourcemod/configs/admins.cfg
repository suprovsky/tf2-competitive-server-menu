 * USE THIS SECTION TO DECLARE DETAILED ADMIN PROPERTIES.
 *
 * Each admin should have its own "Admin" section, followed by a name.
 * The name does not have to be unique.
 *
 * Available properties: (Anything else is filtered as custom)
 *      "auth"          - REQUIRED - Auth method to use.  Built-in methods are:

 *                        "name"   - Name based authentication
 *                        "ip"	- IP based authentication
 *                        Anything else is treated as custom.
 *					 Note: Only one auth method is allowed per entry.
 *
