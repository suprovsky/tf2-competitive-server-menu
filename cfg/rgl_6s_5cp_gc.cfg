// 5cp GOLDEN CAP config for RGL 6s
// Created by stephanie (/id/stephanielgbt)
// Config originally created May 11, 2019 - Updated August 24, 2019
// EXEC THIS MANUALLY, DO NOT EXEC THE BASE.CFG
// This is commented as extensively as I could manage!

// exec "rgl_6s_base" // don't need to exec base cfg again, teams don't typically changelevel after 1st/2nd half anyway

servercfgfile 	"rgl_6s_5cp_gc" // sets server cfg to this config so that it gets autoexeced on level change

mp_timelimit "0" // unsets server timelimit
mp_winlimit "1" // sets # of wins to win the match to >1<
mp_windifference "0" // unsets windifference
mp_maxrounds "0" // unsets maxrounds

mp_tournament_restart // restarts the tournament to apply above settings


say "RGL 6s GOLDEN CAP 5cp Config Executed."
say "First team to cap the other's last point wins the match. There is no time limit."
say "Exec rgl_off or restart your server 90 seconds after you have fully finished playing."
